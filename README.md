# Elbert_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project Summary: The program runs on the VM. The program is designed to create a simple address book using a doubly linked list and simple file operations. It will store names, nicknames, addresses, and cities. The project will not have graphics though.

How to Run: One only needs to open up the VM (Linux) on their Internet and Safari browser. Then from there, one can download the assignment in to the ubuntu/VM file directory and then save the file. Then they can run and compile the code in the terminal window.

Dependencies: This project is very dependent on the VM and the compability that users have with downloading and using the VM.

System requirements: The program runs on ubuntu/VM (Linux) and has the operating system requirements with it. The VM can be downloded on a MAC or Windows computer. The VM will be downloadable on the Windows 7/8 browsers and on some of the MAC browsers.
